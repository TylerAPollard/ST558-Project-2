## Summary Statistics
### Categorical Variables
1. Contigency tables
  * `weathersit` # see the total number of different days with weather situations
  * `season` and `casual` or `count` # see how the number of riders change over the seasons
  * `year` and `registered` or `count` # see how the number of riders change by year
  * `workingday` and `casual` # see how the number of riders change based on workday vs weekend/holiday
  
### Quantitative Variables
1. Create summary tables for (possibly include sd)
  * `temp`
  * `atemp`
  * `humidity`
  * `windpseed`

## Plots
### Barplots
1. `weathersit` # shows the counts for different weather situations

### Histograms
1. y = `count`, x = `year` # show distribution of count over the year (increase)
2. y = `atemp`, x = `month` # show weather distribution of year
3. y = `count`, x = `month` # stacked of registered as bottom part of bar and casual as top to show spontaneity of riders

### Boxplots
1. `count` parsed by `season` # show the number spread based on season
2. `casual` parsed by `workingday` # show spread of riders based on working or not
2b. `casual` and `registered` faceted and parsed by `workingday` # shows the spontaneity of riders based on workday

### Scatter plots
1. `atemp` vs `temp` # show relation between two variables and may reference later why we remove one predictor based on collinearity 
2. `atemp` vs `humidity` # show relation between two variables and may reference later why we remove one predictor based on collinearity 
3. `atemp` vs `windspeed` and `atemp` vs `humidity` faceted # show which weather aspect affects the absolute temp more
4. `weathersit` vs `humidity` color by windspeed # show how these weather aspects affect weather situation ranking, may want to cut the windspeed into ranges
